The future investments and plans for OpenSearch should be viewed as independent of Elasticsearch. Our roadmap will be driven by the needs of the community. Where possible, if new features in OpenSearch are similar to Elasticsearch, we will strive to make the APIs similar. The two projects, however, are distinct. The OpenSearch project is open source and is focused on providing the innovations that our community and customers ask for.
