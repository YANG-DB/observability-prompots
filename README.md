# GitHub Repository: Observability LLM Prompts

## Overview

Welcome to the Observability LLM Prompts GitHub repository! This repository contains a curated collection of LLM (large language model) prompts specifically designed for the observability domain. These prompts aim to facilitate efficient and effective interactions with AI-powered tools, such as OpenAI's GPT models, to assist users in understanding, monitoring, and troubleshooting complex systems.

The prompts in this repository cover various aspects of observability, including logs, metrics, traces, and alerts, as well as related concepts such as distributed systems, infrastructure monitoring, and application performance management.

## Features

* Curated collection of LLM prompts for observability domain
* Covers a wide range of topics, including logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and more
* Regularly updated with new prompts and improvements to existing ones
* Open to community contributions and suggestions
* Includes examples and use cases for each prompt

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Logs**: Prompts related to log analysis, log aggregation, and log management.
