in opensearch an index had a mapping that reflects its structure and fields.
in order to get the indices list from the opensearch cluster one must call the `_cat/indices` API
this api returns a list of indices

Each index can be than called using the `index_name/_mapping` API
This call response has a mapping object field which contains an inner object field named _meta.
The _meta field contains metadata information about the index's mapping - such as
1. "component": "log" - this component field explicitly refers to the observability log template
2. "type": "logs" - this type field explicitly refers to the Observability category type
3. "version": "1.0.0" - this version field refers to the observability schema version
4. "catalog": "observability" - this catalog field refers to the catalog type - in this example the observability

Overall the meta give the capability to understand the catalog, category and explicit components for each index.

For example the  `_cat/indices` returns the next response:

index status: green open, index name: opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_logs ,
index status: green open, index name: opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_flights
index status: green open, index name: sample-http-responses
index status: green open, index name: sso_logs-nginx-prod
index status: green open, index name: sso_metrics-us-prod
index status: green open, index name: sso_traces-us-prod
index status: green open, index name: otel-v1-apm-service-map
index status: green open, index name: .opendistro-job-scheduler-lock
index status: green open, index name: opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce
index status: green open, index name: .opensearch-notifications-config

lets assume we would like to know the catalog and category for the `sso_logs-nginx-prod` index
we will query the index using the next call  `sso_logs-nginx-prod/_mapping`
This will produce the next json response from which we will take the `mapping._meta` field
{
  "sso_logs-nginx-prod": {
    "mappings": {
      "_meta": {
        "component": "log",
        "type": "logs",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "catalog": "observability"
      },
      "_data_stream_timestamp": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      "dynamic_templates": [
        {
          "request_header_map": {
            "path_match": "request.header.*",
...
}

the `mapping._meta` contains the next attributes:
"component": "log", "type": "logs", "version": "1.0.0", "catalog": "observability" and we can infer that the sso_logs-nginx-prod belongs to the observability schema,
it contains log category signals and has the logs template structure.

so the following questions:
 - which observability indices does my system contains ?
 - which logs indices do i have ?
 - what is the mapping type for sso_logs-nginx-prod index ?
can now be answered based on these assumptions
