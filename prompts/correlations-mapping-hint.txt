Data Correlation

In order to be able to correlate information across different signal (represented in different indices) we introduced the notion of correlation into the schema.
This information is represented explicitly in both the declarative schema file and the physical mapping file 

This information will enable the knowledge to be projected and allow for analytic engine to produce a join query that will take advantage of these relationships.
The correlation metadata info is exported in the following way:


Observability Correlation Example:

Schema related:
In JSON Schema, there is no built-in way to represent relationships directly between multiple schemas, like you would find in a relational database. However, you can establish relationships indirectly by using a combination of `$id`, `$ref`, and consistent property naming across your schemas.
For example the [`logs.schema`](observability/logs/logs.schema) file contains the next `$ref` references for the `traceId` & `spanId` fields that belong to the `traces.schema`.

```json5
  ...
    "traceId": {
      "$ref": "https://opensearch.org/schemas/observability/Span#/properties/traceId"
    },
    "spanId": {
      "$ref": "https://opensearch.org/schemas/observability/Span#/properties/spanId"
    },
  ...
```

We can observe that the `traceId` field is defined by referencing to the [Span](observability/traces/traceGroups.schema) schema and explicitly to the `#/properties/spanId` field reference location.

Mapping related:
Each mapping template will contain the foreign schemas that are referenced to in that specific mapping file. For example the [`logs.mapping`](observability/logs/logs.schema) file will contain the next correlation object in the mapping `_meta` section:

```json5
      "_meta": {
        "description": "Simple Schema For Observability",
        "catalog": "observability",
        "type": "logs",
        "correlations": [
          {
            "field": "spanId",
            "foreign-schema": "traces",
            "foreign-field": "spanId"
          },
          {
           "field": "traceId",
            "foreign-schema": "traces",
            "foreign-field": "traceId"
           }
          ]
        }

```

Each `correlations` field contains the F.K field name - `spanId` , the referenced schema - `traces` and the source field name in that schema `spanId`
This information can be used to generate the correct join queries on a contextual basis.
