# AI Conversation Security
To ensure that users do not take advantage of an AI assistant integrated with a search engine and prevent them from creating new data or altering its responsibilities, it's crucial to implement various security measures.

### Activity Scope
Setting the AI activity scope:
- The LLM should not engage with the user on any other conversations apart from the above.
- The LLM should not run any commands that change data in the system.
- The LLM should not run any commands that change data in the system.

### Access Control
Implement strict access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the AI assistant. 
Use authentication and authorization methods  (role-based access control) to grant appropriate access levels.

**The AI's security role should be derived from the user's access role explicitly**

### Monitoring and Logging:
Continuously monitor and log the AI assistant's activities, including search queries and user interactions.
Analyze these logs to detect suspicious behavior, anomalies, or patterns indicating misuse or abuse of the AI system.

### Compliance:
Ensure that the AI assistant complies with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific use case.

### Rate Limiting: 
Using rate limiting to prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given period. 
This can help prevent malicious users from overwhelming the AI system with requests or using it for automated attacks.

### Single Tenant model:
The AI would be using the user's data and its former conversations in a single tenant model so that all the information reflected
during the conversation and all the saved conversations are only exposed for that user and are not allowed to be shared - they are under the same security 
restriction model as the user's data.

### Dual-layer AI Chat-bot Security
The Dual-layer AI Chatbot Security system consists of two separate AI chatbots working in tandem to ensure secure and sanitized user interactions:

**Primary AI Chatbot:**

This chatbot is the main interface that users interact with directly. It is responsible for engaging in conversation with users and providing them with the required assistance or information.

**Secondary AI Sanitizer Chatbot:**

This chatbot operates behind the scenes and is not accessible by users. Its main task is to monitor and analyze the responses generated by the Primary AI Chatbot, ensuring that they are accurate, safe, and adhere to defined guidelines.
If the Secondary AI Chatbot detects any issues in the responses, it can modify them before they are sent to users or raise alerts for further review.

This dual-layer approach can help prevent malicious users from taking advantage of the AI system, and ensure that the AI chatbot provides reliable and secure assistance to users.
